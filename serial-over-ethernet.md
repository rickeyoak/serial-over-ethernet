It doesn't matter how many serial ports you have: with [Serial over Ethernet Connector](https://www.eltima.com/products/serial-over-ethernet/) your computer can have dozens of serial ports with serial devices connected to it. Even if the shared COM port device is physically in the other part of the world you will be able to access it as if it was connected to your computer. When the attached serial port device sends communication data, it is actually transmitted over TCP/IP network and back from the network to your serial device.
